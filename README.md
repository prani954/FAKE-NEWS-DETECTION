**PROJECT TITLE**

*FAKE NEW DETECTION*

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

This project explores a multimodal approach for fake news detection, integrating natural language processing and machine learning. 
Leveraging LSTM, SVM, KNN, Naive bayes, Random Forest, Feature Extraction and Decision Tree models, 
alongside visualizations like training history plots and confusion matrices, we address the challenges of identifying misinformation. 
Data pre-processing includes lemmatization and oversampling to enhance model robustness. 
Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, providing insights for future research in fake news mitigation.
