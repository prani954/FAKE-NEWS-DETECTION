**PROJECT TITLE**

*FAKE NEWS DETECTION*

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

1. In this project, we delved into a multimodal strategy for detecting fake news by combining natural language processing and machine learning. 
2. Employing a variety of models such as LSTM, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Feature Extraction, and Decision Tree.
3. Incorporating visual aids like training history plots and confusion matrices, we tackle the complexities of spotting misinformation.
4. Our data pre-processing includes lemmatization and oversampling to boost the robustness of the models.
5. The obtained results underscore the efficacy of our approach, providing valuable insights into mitigating fake news.
